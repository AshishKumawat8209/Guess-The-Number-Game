# Guess-The-Number-Game
This fun project is a simple number guessing game where the player must guess a number between 1 and 100. The player has 10 chances to guess the correct number, receiving a hint after each attempt to indicate how close their guess is to the target number.

# Fun Fact:
# Do you know that, How the Number Guessing Game teaches Binary Search:

In Binary Search, we repeatedly divide the search space in half to find a target.

In this game:

The number is between 1 and 100 — this is your search space.

You make a guess — the program says "higher" or "lower" — just like Binary Search eliminates half the range.

Based on the hint:

If the guess is too low → Search the higher half.

If the guess is too high → Search the lower half.

Repeat until the number is found (or chances end).
